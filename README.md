This example demonstrates a common error when using the REDEFINES clause in COBOL.  Incorrectly using REDEFINES can lead to unexpected data truncation or corruption because the data structures overlap in memory.  The provided solution shows how to properly use REDEFINES to avoid these issues.  Ensure that REDEFINES structures are carefully designed to avoid memory conflicts and data overwriting. This problem arises frequently when dealing with complex data structures in COBOL.
